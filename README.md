# myTimer üçÖ

A flexible, command-line Pomodoro-style focus timer for macOS, designed for developers, writers, and anyone looking to manage their work and break intervals effectively.

This tool can control system volume, pause and play Apple Music, or launch a YouTube video to provide an audio backdrop for your focus sessions. It's built with Node.js and is highly configurable through simple command-line flags.

## Features

  * **Three Operating Modes:**
      * **System Mute Mode:** Mutes and unmutes the system volume for silent, focused work.
      * **Apple Music Mode:** Controls the Music app by playing a specific playlist, then pausing for breaks and resuming for work. Can search the Apple Music catalog if a playlist isn't in your local library.
      * **YouTube Mode:** Launches a specified YouTube URL in your default browser at the start of a session.
  * **Fully Configurable Intervals:** Customize the duration of work intervals, break intervals, and the total number of cycles using simple command-line flags.
  * **Intelligent Logic:**
      * Saves and restores your original system volume instead of just muting/unmuting.
      * Gracefully exits with a clear error message if a specified local Apple Music playlist is not found.
      * Skips the final, redundant break by default to end your session cleanly.
  * **User-Friendly Notifications:**
      * Provides timestamped status updates in the terminal.
      * Plays a series of audible beeps when the entire focus session is complete.

## Usage

Once linked, you can call `myTimer` directly from your terminal. Here are some examples for the different modes.

#### System Mute Mode

This is the default mode. It's perfect for focused work where you want any background audio to be silenced during breaks.

  * **Run a standard session (4 cycles of 25 min work / 5 min break):**
    ```bash
    myTimer
    ```
  * **Run a "deep work" session (2 cycles of 50 min work / 10 min break):**
    ```bash
    myTimer -w 50 -b 10 -i 2
    ```

#### Apple Music Mode

This mode controls the Music app. Specify a playlist to begin your session.

  * **Play a playlist from your library:**
    ```bash
    myTimer --playlist "Deep Focus"
    ```
  * **Search the Apple Music catalog if the playlist isn't in your library:**
    ```bash
    myTimer --playlist "Lofi Beats" --search
    ```

#### YouTube Mode

This mode launches a YouTube video for background music or ambience.

  * **Start a session with a YouTube video:**
    ```bash
    myTimer "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk"
    ```
